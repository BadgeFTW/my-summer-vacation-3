<h1>My Summer Vacation</h1> 

<p>I worked all summer but on my days off i had a little fun. Me and my girlfriend
went to ashville and to atlanta. 


<h2>Ashville</h2>
<p>Ashville is a great city with good cultural heritage and amazing views. We spent the day in ashville just relaxing 
walking around, before sunset we drove onto the blue ridge highway. It is an amazing road, really makes me 
wish i brought my car up there.

<h2>Atlanta</h2>
<p>About a week after going to ashville we went to atlanta. It was pretty good as we went to the zoo 
and the aquarium then to downtown Atlanta.
